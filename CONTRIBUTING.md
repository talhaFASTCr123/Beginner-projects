<h2>Submitting Contributions 👩‍💻👨‍💻</h2>
<p>Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To add your beginner-friendly project, first check if it is already there.</li>
    <li>Fork the project (star it if you like the project).</li>
    <li>Check if there is a folder for the language used in your project.</li>
    <li>If the language folder is already created, add your single-file project to the respective language folder and commit changes.</li>
    <li>If the language folder is not created, create the language folder in <strong>capital letters</strong> in the main branch, then add your project in the folder and commit changes.</li>
    <li>Go to your repository in the browser and click on "Compare & Pull Requests". Then, add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.</li>
